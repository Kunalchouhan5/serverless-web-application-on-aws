# serverless-web-application-on-aws
**Building a serverless web application on AWS** typically involves using various AWS services to handle different aspects of your application, such as compute, storage, databases, authentication, and more. In this example, I'll guide you through the process of creating a simple serverless web application using AWS services like AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon S3, and Amazon DynamoDB.


## Module
This tutorial is divided into five modules. Each module describes a scenario of what we're going to build and step-by-step directions to help you implement the architecture and verify your work. 

- **Host a Static Website**: Configure AWS Amplify to host the static resources for your web application with continuous deployment built in
- **Manage Users**: Create an Amazon Cognito user pool to manage your users' accounts
- **Build a Serverless Backend**: Build a backend process for handling requests for your web application
- **Deploy a RESTful API**: Use Amazon API Gateway to expose the Lambda function you built in the previous module as a RESTful API
- **Terminate Resources**: Terminate all the resources you created throughout this tutorial
